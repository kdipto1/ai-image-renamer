   ‚Ä¢ Better, cleaner filenames

üí° TIPS:
   ‚Ä¢ First run takes longer due to model download
   ‚Ä¢ Close other GPU-intensive apps for best performance
   ‚Ä¢ Use BLIP-2 for maximum accuracy (slower)
   ‚Ä¢ Check renaming_log.txt for detailed results

‚ùì PROBLEMS?
   ‚Ä¢ Read README_Windows.md for troubleshooting
